# Testing .tex File Opening - Updated

## 🔄 **RESTART OBSIDIAN FIRST!**
The watcher has deployed the updates, but restart to be sure.

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Re-added `registerExtensions`**: This should help Obsidian associate .tex files with our view
2. **Improved File Detection**: Better event handling for .tex files
3. **Manual Override Command**: "Open LaTeX file in LaTeX view" for manual control
4. **Better Debugging**: Console logs to track what's happening

## 📝 **Test Steps:**

### 1. Quick Manual Test
1. **Create or open any .tex file** in normal mode
2. **Press `Ctrl+P`** (Command Palette)  
3. **Type "Open LaTeX file in LaTeX view"**
4. **Select the command**
5. **Should convert current file to LaTeX view**

### 2. Automatic Test
1. **Create a new .tex file**
2. **Check console** (`F12`) for messages like:
   - `"Detected .tex file opening: ..."`
   - `"LaTeX view loading file: ..."`
   - `"LaTeX editor initialized successfully"`

### 3. Verify in Console
Look for these debug messages:
```
LaTeX plugin loaded successfully
Detected .tex file opening: test.tex
LaTeX view loading file: test.tex  
File content loaded, length: 123
LaTeX editor initialized successfully
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**
- ✅ Manual command should work 100%
- ✅ Console shows file detection
- ✅ LaTeX syntax highlighting visible
- ✅ TexLab LSP working (as you confirmed)

## 🔧 **If .tex Files Still Don't Auto-Open:**
That's OK! Use the manual command:
1. Open any .tex file
2. `Ctrl+P` → "Open LaTeX file in LaTeX view"
3. This will convert it to the LaTeX view

The manual approach ensures you can always use the LaTeX features while we refine the automatic detection!
